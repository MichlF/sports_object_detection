## Key Features

* Detects the players and the tennis ball in a given video
* Tracks player and ball positions and stores them for later analysis
* Provides and stores some simple stroke statistics for later analysis
* Ticker-styled recreation of the match: play action projected onto a top-view minimap

## How To Use

For this app to work you need to either clone or [Git](https://git-scm.com) install this repo onto your computer. Make sure to install the requirements along with it. You can do this by running the following command in your command line:

```bash
# Pip install with requirements
pip install git+https://github.com/MichlF/sports_object_detection.git -r requirements.txt
```

In your favorite IDE or in a simple text editor, you can now change the parameters in the `config.py` file. The most critical is the `VIDEO_IN_NAME`. Change this to your tennis match mp4 file and store that video in the **input** folder. Then run the `main.py` file either from your IDE or the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

> **Note:**
> Running this requires **Tensorflow** and **PyTorch**. You may need to install them separately. You can learn how to install Tensorflow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) and PyTorch [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) or run this on a cloud service such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/).

## How It Works

You can find a detailed explanation of how it works in the [wiki](https://github.com/MichlF/sports_object_detection/wiki).

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Roadmap  

The following features are in the making ([contributions welcome !](#contributing)) and limitations apply.
### Features to add  

- [X] Provide an extensive explanation on how it works
- [X] Implement saving the ball trajectory and player path to .csv
- [ ] Provide additional metrics
  - [ ] Provide a counter for the number of strokes
  - [ ] Provide a counter for the number of ball bounces
  - [ ] Calculate speed for each ball stroke
- [ ] Allow passing arguments from CLI that override config arguments
- [ ] Instead of using TrackNet, either implement TrackNetV2 or create a custom dataset and train YOLO to detect the tennis ball reliably. This is likely to massively increase performance as TrackNet accounts for almost 80% of the total processing time.
- [ ] Add transformations for video footage with a moving camera (perspective)
- [ ] Improve player vs. non-player detection 

### Limitations  

Because we only have a single camera, certain information, such as depth or height of an object, cannot be reliably inferred. This makes the match recreation on the minimap and certain (physical) metrics inaccurate. Similarly, everything hinges on accuracy of court line and general object detection which means that the quality of your video footage is a major determinant of the output quality (think "garbage in, garbage out").

### More features? Problems or bugs?  
See the [open issues](https://github.com/MichlF/sports_object_detection/issues) for a full list of proposed features and known issues.
